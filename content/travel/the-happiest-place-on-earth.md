My daughter and I spent a long weekend in Florida to visit Disney World with my family. 

Day 1 - Magic Kingdom - My daughter terrified me by wanting to go on the orbiter ride  in tomorrowland, which set off my fear of heights but which shefound very enjoyable. My sister & I braved a long line to hit up Space Mountain, which was closed when we wentto Disneyland as a family in 1995. Also a big hit was the big parade down the main street where we saw all the Disney princesses and Mickey & Minnie.

Day 2 - Disney Hollywood Studios. my daughter had a great time at Toy Story Land and particularly enjoyed the spinning saucers ride. I was able to spend a bit of time in Black Spire Outpost satisfying my star wars nerdiness - eating a ronto wrap, flying the Millenium Falcon (turns out I'm not a very good pilot), and constructing a custom lightsaber at Savi's workshop... which was then too big to fit in my suitcase and had to be Fedex'ed home.

Day 3 - Epcot - We had a half day at Epcot before heading to the airport, where we got to meet Anna and Elsa, and go on the Frozen ride. A big hit!
