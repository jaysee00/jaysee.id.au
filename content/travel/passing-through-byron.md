2020 didn't have much opportunity for travel, with the global coronavirus pandemic restricting international travel in and out of Australia and also creating travel restrictions for interstate movements. 

At the end of the first wave of the outbreak in Sydney, the border between New South Wales and Queensland was opened for the first time since the pandemic began.  We used the opportunity to travel up to Brisbane to see my family, and also spent a few days in Byron Bay to break up the journey. We had some friends also holidaying in Byron at the same time, so we were able to hang out and have the kids play together. 

Some memorable moments of the trip include visiting the Cape Byron lighthouse (and seeing a pod of dolphins playing in the water) and desperately running around Byron Bay in the morning of our departure looking for a place to print out a paper copy of the border clearance we needed to cross into Queensland during the pandemic.
