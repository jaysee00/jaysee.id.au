I was grateful for the opportunity to travel to Amsterdam to visit Atlassian's Amsterdam office and connect with some of my European colleagues. While most of the week was spent hunkered down in conference rooms, I enjoyed the occasional opportunity to get out and walk within the city's bohemian and picturesque centre. 

I did get a little bit of time to myself, so I was able to visit the Rijksmuseum, take a boat trip through the city's canals and of course, eat some cheese and stroopwaffels!
