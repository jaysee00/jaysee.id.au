During the summer of 2018 we took a road trip to Terlingua in West Texas. We stayed in a comfy tipi (thanks, [Base Camp Terlingua](https://www.basecampterlingua.com/)) and spent the weekend exploring the ruins of the Terlingua ghost town (centered around an abandoned  cinnabar mine) and driving in to Big Bend National Park. In the park we took a very short hike around Casa Granda and "the window"; a picturesque part of the park a valley between two mountains almost perpetually shrouded in fog.

Our first night in the tipi was punctuated by a wild desert thunderstorm, with lightning and torrential rain buffeting the camp site all night. The proprietors of the camp graciously provided a canvas tarp as a 'topsheet' for the bed to keep us dry :)
