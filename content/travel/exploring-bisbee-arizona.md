In our quest to see as much of North America as possible, we spent a weekend in Southeast Arizona, exploring Bisbee and its surrounds. Bisbee is a former copper mining town with a well preserved, historic main street; now full of art galleries, antique stores, coffee shops and bars (aka. right up our alley!). We squeezed in a day trip to Tombstone, site of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and took in some Arizona highway scenery on the drive to and from the airport in Phoenix.
