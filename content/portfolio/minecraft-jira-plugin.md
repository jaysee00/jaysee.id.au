Back when Minecraft was at the peak of its *zeitgeist*, I created a Minecraft/Jira integration for ShipIt. 

Although I didn't win ShipIt, I did make it to the final round of voting, and my entry was so well-received the Jira team decided to include it in the marketing launch of JIRA 5.0. 

I worked with our marketing team to create a little video showing off the new APIs in JIRA 5.0:
