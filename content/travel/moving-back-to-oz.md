As our working visas in the USA approached their fourth renewal and our daughter approached school age, we knew our time in the USA was coming to an end. We sold our house in Austin, organized Australian citizenship and passport for our daughter, got the removalists in and packed our bags for Sydney. 

The actual trip was mostly uneventful, except that our flight from Dallas to Sydney was delayed by five hours. Instead of boarding the plane at 7:45pm (quite respectable!) we departed at 12:45am (a circle of hell!) and arrived in Australia totally shattered.

In hindsight, we were extremely fortunate to arrive back home in Australia only months before the outbreak of the global coronavirus pandemic. I am forever thankful that we weathered the initial outbreak from the relative safety of Australia.
