At the end of 2020, after a long a pretty crappy year being isolated from friends and family in Sydney, we decided to move to Perth. Fortunately our employer decided to embrace a flexible work location policy during the pandemic, so we were able to move interstate while still keeping our work lives the same. 

Moving to Perth gave us the opportunity to live much closer to family, and enjoy a slower and less crowded pace of life than in Sydney. 

Flying to Perth during the pandemic required the submission of a border travel exemption to the West Australian police force, and a self-quarantine period of 14 days after arrival.
