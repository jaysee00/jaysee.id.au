After a few hectic nights in Rome, we caught a train from *Termini* in Rome to Bari *Centrale*, where we hired a car, picked up some other members of the family and drove on-ward to our airbnb in San Marco, a little community about ten minutes out from Locorotondo.

Our accommodation was pretty rustic, but situated in a beautiful part of the Apulia region in Italy, and our courtyard had fantastic views of a nearby valley.

Over the next week, we made several day trips into Locorotondo, Monopoli and Polignano a Mare. There was no shortage of beautiful churches, architecture, public works and natural vistas to admire.

Other highlights of our time included an Orechiette pasta making session with a local nonna, and a moderately successful attempt at using the wood-fired pizza oven in the house to make our own pizzas from scratch.

All too soon, it was time to drive our car back to Rome for our flight out of Fiumicino and back to Austin.
