We visited Monterrey for the Labor Day long weekend, flying in on Friday afternoon and driving back on Monday. 

Staying in an airbnb in San Pedro Garza Garcia, we had great access to downtown Monterrey and its surrounds. Highlight of the trip was a day visiting the *Parque Fundidora*, a defunct steel foundry converted into a museum and public parkland. The tour of the fundidora included a walkthrough one of the 3 massive furnaces, and an elevator ride to the top of the structure (about 40m high). The park is accessible directly from central Monterrey via the Paseo San Lucia, a landscaped walking path with a canal running through it. The canal offers a return boat service for tourists to get to the park easily, with cool landscaping, artwork and sculuptures along the way. 

We also spent a day driving out to Santiago, a nearby city, for a walk through the historic town square and an authentic meal (I had Chile Relleno con Cabrito; a poblano pepper stuffed with cheese and goat meat, then battered and fried). 

Excellent tacos were had every day of the trip! Of particular note, some fantastic *tacos de lechón*; corn tortillas with a cut of roasted suckling pig, served with avocado crema and pickled red onion. *Muy delicioso*!

The return trip was uneventful, save for a land crossing into the USA in Laredo; a novel experience for those of us used to enter a foreign country by air!
