## Developing

Run `yarn build` to run the pubish operation, creating the output in the `build/` folder.

Run `yarn dev:start` to run a local environment on the published output.

Requires `nodemon` to be installed globally in your development environment via `yarn global add nodemon`. 

Run `nodemon src/index.js` to auto rebuild during local dev.
