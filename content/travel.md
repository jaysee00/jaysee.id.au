From an early age I've had both fortune and gratitude as a world traveller. I find meaning and enjoyment in putting my feet down in new locales. In an effort to capture some of these experiences for posterity (and to have an excuse to support some form of dynamic content on this site), I've chronicled some of my journeys here.
