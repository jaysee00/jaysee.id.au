While my family was viaiting Austin for the Formula 1, my daughter and  I came along for the practice day to see what the fuss was all about. I was a bit worried how the day would go, since she doesn't particularly like loud noises and I don't really like big crowds (hence we came on the practice day and not on the actual race day), but it turned out great!

My daughter loved sitting in the stands with her headphones on watching the cars race by, and we had a good day wandering around seeing all the associated Formula 1 paraphenalia.
