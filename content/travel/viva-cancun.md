We enjoyed a long weekend getaway to Cancun over the US 4th of July weekend. A direct flight from Austin to Cancun followed by a private shuttle from the airport had us gracing the gratuitously marble-ensconced foyer of the Grand at Moon Palace Resort. 

Highlights for the weekend included the dazzling array of restaurants in the resort (Lebanese, Italian, Pan-asian, French, and "the grand buffet"), an afternoon at the on-site water park and my wife going a bit too hard on the tequila in the mini bar!  Soaking up some time in the many pools in the resort was great, but it did take us Aussies a bit of time to get used to the 'warm bath' water of the Caribbean Sea!

Friday night included "dinner & a show" with a Michael Jackson tribute performance in the main ballroom. Socks were not blown off, but one person in particular thought it was the most amazing thing she'd ever seen.

A long weekend walking between the pool, the food and nap time was a welcome change of pace from our whirlwind "see-as-much-as-possible-in-a-short-time" trips this year.
