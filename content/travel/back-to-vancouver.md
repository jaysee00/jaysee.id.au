As resident aliens in the USA, we have to leave the country once every 2 years to apply for a new working visa. We headed back to Vancouver for a week to process the visa application, and used the time to explore the city. Highlights included visits to the Chinese Garden (the first traditional scholar's garden ever built outside of China!), Science World, swimming in second beach pool, walking the seawall and posing with the Inukshuk, dumplings in Chinatown and visiting the top of Vancouver lookout. 

We also hired a car over the weekend and drove up the coastal highway to Squamish, stopping off at the Brittania Mine Museum on the way.
