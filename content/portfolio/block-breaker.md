I've been taking a course on Udemy about game development using Unity. Progress been slow, but I did complete a milestone this year when I finished working on one of the tutorials to build a 'block breaker' style game. 

Building this game involved my first use of some of the physics features of Unity (collisions, etc.) and creating my own reusable prefab elements. 

I can't take credit for the game design, any of the art assets or the game logic (which is also covered as part of the online course), but I did enjoy putting it all together.
