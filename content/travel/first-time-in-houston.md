We spent 2 nights in Houston, which is about a 4 hour drive away from Austin. The primary motivator for the journey was to visit the Australian Consulate General and apply for our daughter's Australian passport. We managed to sneak in some other big tickets into our itinerary. Highlights of the weekend included:

1. A surprisingly fantastic Italian meal at [North Italia](https://www.northitalia.com/locations/houston-tx-blvd-place/)
2. A trip to the Johnson Space Center, including a tour of the Apollo Mission Control Center; which was recently restored to its original 1969 condition.
3. Discovery of an Australian-owned brewery ("[Platypus Brewing](http://www.platypusbrewing.com/)") with authentic meat pies on the menu.
